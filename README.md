## üöö About This Project

As a working truck driver, I built this tool to solve a real problem I face on the job: estimating how many carts and bins will fit into different trailer types.

Manual calculation on the fly is time-consuming and error-prone ‚Äî especially when you're dealing with multiple types of laundry carts, bins, and changing trailer specs. This app simplifies that process by letting you enter your load items and instantly get recommendations on what trailers can handle it.

Whether you're loading a pup, a 50ft trailer, or a straight truck ‚Äî this planner does the math so you can focus on the road.
