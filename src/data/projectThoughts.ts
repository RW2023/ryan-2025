  "swoletrac-workout-app": `
## 🚀 Why I Built This
I wanted a fitness companion that **mirrors my real workouts** sets, reps, progressive overload not another calorie counter.

## ⚔️ Challenges
- Wrangling **Next.js authentication** (middleware, callbacks, redirects).  
- Staying motivated while learning unfamiliar patterns.

## 🌟 Proud Code
The *workout-streak* logic is tiny but mighty seeing that green streak bar motivates me to lace up for a walk just to keep it alive.

  // ───────────── load-planner ─────────────
  "load-planner": `
## 🚚 Why I Built This
As a local trucker I’d rather let code **do math** so I can focus on the road.

## ⚔️ Challenges
Building from scratch no starter templates meant:  
1. Designing a custom use case app.  
2. Testing edge cases on the job at 2 a.m.

## 🌟 Proud Code
1. The **sideways-loading check** is a nice feature to instantly let me know when the load will be a PITA. 
2. The trailer indicator lets me know which size truck or trailer I can use at a glance.

  "personal-portfolio": `
## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio to display what I wanted to show and how i wanted to show it. Not just a resume but a dynamic portfolio that shows what I can do *and* how I think.

## ⚔️ Challenges

1. Designing something that balances creativity with professionalism.
2. Pulling together code snippets, project logic, and deployment details into a single, smooth experience.

## 🌟 Proud Code

1. Dynamic routing with project slugs keeps the site scalable as I add more work.
2. The conditional GitHub and README rendering shows attention to UX and error-proofing.

  "pet-age-calculator": `
## 🐾 Why I Built This

My kids kept asking how old our new kitten was “in human years.” I realized most charts out there are oversimplified or inconsistent so I built something better. This was also a perfect excuse to sharpen my front-end skills with a real-world use case.

## ⚔️ Challenges

1. Creating a conversion logic that felt more accurate and dynamic than the usual "x7 rule."
2. Making the UI feel fun and family-friendly without sacrificing clean code, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## 🌟 Proud Code

1. The **\`calculatePetAge\` function** handles dogs and cats, supports both directions, and adjusts for dog size making it far more flexible than a basic chart.
2. The **theme-aware UI** built with Tailwind, DaisyUI, and Next.js showcases polished design and responsiveness across devices.

## 🎤 Why I Built This

My brother is a solo reggae artist and needed a site that truly represented his music, style, and story. This wasn't just a portfolio—it’s a living press kit, streaming hub, and event listing all rolled into one.

## ⚔️ Challenges

1. Creating a layout that felt modern and clean while still having personality.
2. Managing dynamic content like events, media embeds, and page routing without a CMS.

## 🌟 Proud Code

1. The **event filter logic** cleanly splits past and upcoming shows based on date, then animates them into a responsive grid layout with Framer Motion.
2. The **streaming section** and **press kit** were built with future growth in mind easy to update and styled to match the artist's brand without bloating performance.

  "countries-explorer": `
## 🌍 Why I Built This
When I started to learn to code one of my virtual classmates made a countries explorer app with react. It was my first exposure to apis and the power of dynamic data. I wanted to recreate that experience with a modern stack and my own twist.
## ⚔️ Challenges
1. Working with the REST Countries API to fetch and display data dynamically.
2. Making sure dynamic route generation worked properly with Next.js.
3. Trying to pull the most out of the countries API in a creative way.
## 🌟 Proud Code
I like when data starts to flow. Very satisfying to me for some reason. So setting up the API and fetching the data is always my favorite part of working with API's.
