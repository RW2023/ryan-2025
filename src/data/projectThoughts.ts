## 🚀 Why I Built This
I wanted a fitness companion that **mirrors my real workouts** sets, reps, progressive overload not another calorie counter.

## ⚔️ Challenges
- Wrangling **Next.js authentication** (middleware, callbacks, redirects).  
- Staying motivated while learning unfamiliar patterns.

## 🌟 Proud Code
The *workout-streak* logic is tiny but mighty seeing that green streak bar motivates me to lace up for a walk just to keep it alive.

## 🚚 Why I Built This
As a local trucker I’d rather let code **do math** so I can focus on the road.

## ⚔️ Challenges
Building from scratch no starter templates meant:  
1. Designing a custom use case app.  
2. Testing edge cases on the job at 2 a.m.

## 🌟 Proud Code
1. The **sideways-loading check** is a nice feature to instantly let me know when the load will be a PITA. 
2. The trailer indicator lets me know which size truck or trailer I can use at a glance.
