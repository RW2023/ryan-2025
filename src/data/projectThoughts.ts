## 🚀 Why I Built This
I wanted a fitness companion that **mirrors my real workouts** sets, reps, progressive overload not another calorie counter.

## ⚔️ Challenges
- Wrangling **Next.js authentication** (middleware, callbacks, redirects).  
- Staying motivated while learning unfamiliar patterns.

## 🌟 Proud Code
The *workout-streak* logic is tiny but mighty seeing that green streak bar motivates me to lace up for a walk just to keep it alive.

## 🚚 Why I Built This
As a local trucker I’d rather let code **do math** so I can focus on the road.

## ⚔️ Challenges
Building from scratch no starter templates meant:  
1. Designing a custom use case app.  
2. Testing edge cases on the job at 2 a.m.

## 🌟 Proud Code
1. The **sideways-loading check** is a nice feature to instantly let me know when the load will be a PITA. 
2. The trailer indicator lets me know which size truck or trailer I can use at a glance.

"personal-portfolio": `
## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio to display what I wanted to show and how i wanted to show it. Not just a resume but a dynamic portfolio that shows what I can do *and* how I think.

## ⚔️ Challenges

1. Designing something that balances creativity with professionalism.
2. Pulling together code snippets, project logic, and deployment details into a single, smooth experience.

## 🌟 Proud Code

1. Dynamic routing with project slugs keeps the site scalable as I add more work.
2. The conditional GitHub and README rendering shows attention to UX and error-proofing.
